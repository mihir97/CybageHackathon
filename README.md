# CybageHackathon
This app aims at making cities cleaner by crowdsourcing.
Most of the people now-a-days don't want to litter surroundings but have problems finding a dustbin, 
this app addresses this issue and allows users to locate dustbin and share its location with others.
The app can be used anonymously but has a review feature to avoid spamming.
The app shows you nearby locations of dustbins reported by other users and users can get navigation directions to those.
